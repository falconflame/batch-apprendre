# batch-apprendre
Repo for learning some batch scripting in windows. This is just some simple scripting in batch. Created by me again, a guy not related to IT, as a learning process.

Any code here come from different sources or originate from my idea and sight. You could freely use the code here or change or modify it anyway you like.
